                p Send a gift to your special one! If you want to succeed with a chosen Ukrainian lady and melt her heart, a romantic gift is a proven approach. Make the right start with your special woman. Ukrainian ladies are known for their inner openness, heart sincerity and caring natures. They are the most giving and sharing type of personality. In continuance to inner generosity, ladies subconsciously pay attention if a man can reveal a similar attitude and show his opened care about his beloved. In Slavic culture lady traditionally pays much attention not to words, but to the way a man shows his attitude during courtship.
